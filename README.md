#### Get the list of Threat intel sources with the indicators- [APIthreatindicatorswithsource.py](https://github.com/asingh028/Sumologic-API-Call-Scripts/blob/main/APIthreatindicatorswithsource.py)
Script to export threat intel in CSE with the sources and indicators all together- might be helpful in providing a consolidate view of your threat intel sources and indicators- Use case is if you face indicators not been malicious but still generating signals, and you want to quickly identify the source of the indicator and since no export button is there yet in Cloud SIEM UI, you have to manually drill down on the sources. The Csv file you get from this API call script will give you consolidated view and quick reference to cleanup unnecessary indicators from the sources.
